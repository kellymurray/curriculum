Now, remember Minimum Viable Product.

- Forget about the new game screen
- Forget about the win! screen
- Forget about the lose screen
- Forget about the timer
- Forget about lives
- Focus on getting the actual game to work first! Then focus on the next
feature.

### Routing

Use routing to enable users to share links to the "new game" screen, to the
"hard game" screen and the "easy game" screen. The "win game" and "lose game"
screens should not be accessible via routes, but only as the result of either
winning or losing the game.
