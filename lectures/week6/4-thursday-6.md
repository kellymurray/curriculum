# Thursday, Week 6

Angular cont...

Not sure what our pace will have been on Weds, so Thurs will be either review,
or continuing to dive into Angular to get all of the bits and pieces that
you'll need for your Memory game.

## Assignment

Hola! Your mission is to write this using Angular:

http://chrisdavies.github.io/memory/

Now, remember Minimum Viable Product.

- Forget about the new game screen
- Forget about the win! screen
- Forget about the lose screen
- Forget about the timer
- Forget about lives
- Focus on getting the actual game to work first! Then focus on the next
feature.

### Gotchas

I don't know if I'll remember to mention it in class, but Angular doesn't play
nice with setTimeout. If you want to do setTimeout (e.g. to get the clock
  working). Then, you need to look into using this:

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout

I just saved you hours of headache. You're welcome. :)
