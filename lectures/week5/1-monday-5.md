## Assignment

Make a project called: "movable"

Make an editable "powerpoint" slide.

Woah! Sound crazy? Here's what I mean.

Create a page like our move pages from here:

https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/wk5/tree/master/src

It should look something like this:

![Power Point](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/powerpoint.png)

I should be able to click the text or image and move them around.

You should prevent me from dragging the items outside of the bounds of the powerpoint rectangle.

### Hard Mode

Allow resize of element(s)

Create a toolbar that allows me to add more elements to the page

### Nightmare Mode

Make the element(s) text or images instead of just placeholders

When I click the text, show a dialog (or something) that lets me edit the text.

When I click the image, show a dialog (or something) that lets me edit the image URL.

Allow rotating of element(s)

Figure out how to enable users to resize elements (not just move them)

Use localstorage to remember the changes a user makes to a slide

Add/remove slides
