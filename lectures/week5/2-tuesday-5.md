If not, you need to!

## Talking points

- Intro to regex
- Intro to variadic functions
- Reordering a list
- Tying regex and list reorder together FTW!!!
- Prototypal inheritance

## Assignment

Install rails:

Just wanted to get that out of the way, so we have a few days to troubleshoot if
something goes wrong!

### Reorder

If you didn't make a PowerPoint-like project yesterday, that's OK.

Start here. Make a reorderable list of slides:

![Power Point Reorder](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/powerpoint-reorder.png)

A user should be able to click and drag an item from this list up or down to
reorder the list.

Items should be numbered, and when reordering, you should update item numbers
to reflect their new position(s). (You can't just use ols to do this!)

Once you've done that, try to make a slide where you can reorder items.

Once you've done that, take a crack at yesterday's hard mode so that you have
something that almost feels like a working powerpoint builder!

Don't kill yourself on this. Push yourself. Work hard. Play with it.

See how you can make it as slick as possible. But get to bed at a
decent hour!
