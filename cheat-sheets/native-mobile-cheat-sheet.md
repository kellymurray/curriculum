# iOS, Android, and Win Phone development

Some of you have asked me about doing native mobile development. My answer has generally been, "Sure, if you want to learn 3 different languages, each targeting a specific platform."

There are lots of tools out there to help you develop native apps across iOS, Android, and Win Phone using your good ol' familiar JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Here are a few options. You write in HTML5, and you get a native application, publishable in the various app stores.

Here's a different framework. It doesn't produce a native app, but it helps you build "native-feeling" Angular websites.

Finally, there's phone gap which basically wraps your HTML5 content in a web browser that looks and feels native(ish):
