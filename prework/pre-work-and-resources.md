# Pre-work and resources

TODO: Formal logic reading for prework

None of these are prerequisites for the IronYard's FE course, but having a cursory knowledge of these things should prove useful.

## Learn HTML and CSS

[Here's](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422485062&sr=8-1&keywords=html+and+css) a book that many people highly reccommend on the subject. Give it a go, if books are your thing.

Be really familiar with when you'd use:

position: fixed
position: relative
position: absolute
margin
padding
border
background
color

There are lots of great resources for learning CSS/HTML.

Here's one:
http://www.w3schools.com/css/

I personally prefer just reading about it on MDN:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background

And tinkering with it here:
http://codepen.io/pen/

Take a stab at laying out a real website using HTML and CSS. Here's one, if you don't want to find your own: https://www.mint.com/

Try to build that yourself with CSS and HTML. The further you get, the easier your first week will be!

## Next, get familiar with JavaScript

Definitely read this. I'd suggest reading it cover-to-cover, but definitely get through the first 5-6 chapters:
http://eloquentjavascript.net/

And then do some CodeCademy JavaScript exercises. The more familiarity with JS you have, the better!

Read some MDN articles on it:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

... and play with it here:

http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output

## Set up your Mac:

Install git:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

And learn about git. (GitHub has some great tutorials on it.)

Install Node:
http://nodejs.org/download/

And make sure that when you type npm in the terminal, you don't get a big error screen!

## Learn a Bit About Fonts

See if you can find good answers to these questions:

1. What's the optimal font-size? Is there one?
2. Is there an optimal ratio between font-size and line-height?
3. Is there an optimal line-length/column-width (hint: sort of)? What is it?

## Learn a Bit About Design

Great start:

Here are some books. These aren't technical, so probably won't help you immediately with the IronYard course, but are great resources to help clarify your thinking on design. I'll be bringing these into the IronYard, so look for them there when the cohort starts.

[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416519930&sr=8-1&keywords=don%27t+make+me+think)

[Any of Edward Tufte's books](http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416519965&sr=8-2&keywords=edward+tufte)
